### Theme
- **theme**: Theme configuration.
  - Path: `src/theme/theme.ts`
  - Exports: colors, fonts, buttons, forms, icons

## Pages
- **Home**: Main home page component.
  - Path: `src/pages/Home.tsx`
  - Imports: React, MainLayout, BrowseSection, HeroSection, CategorySelector, theme

## Observations

- **Barrel Importing**: The project utilizes barrel importing to consolidate exports from multiple modules within a directory. This is evident in files like `src/components/index.ts`, `src/components/Browse/index.ts`, and `src/components/Browse/Sidebar/index.ts`, where multiple components are exported from a single file. This simplifies import statements in other parts of the application.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. This is indicated by the presence of `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` in the `devDependencies` of `package.json`, as well as the `@tailwind` directives in `src/index.css`. Tailwind CSS is used extensively for styling components with utility classes.

- **Component Nesting by Feature**: Components are nested by feature, creating a clear hierarchy. For example, the `BrowseSection` component contains sub-components like `BrowseTopbar` and `FilterSidebar`, which are further divided into more specific components. This structure promotes modularity and maintainability.
